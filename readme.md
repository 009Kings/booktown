#SQL Books

For each item below figure out the approriate SQL. Create a text file that contains all of your answers and submit it in the Homework repo.

##Getting Started

To get started we'll need to import the booktown.sql file.

1. open terminal
2. use the command `psql -f booktown.sql`
3. type `psql` to open your psql console
4. type \list to ensure the booktown database was successfully completed
5. type `\c booktown` to connect to the booktown database
6. type `\d` to see a list of all the tables in the booktown database
7. type `\d [TABLE_NAME]` to see information about columns and their types for a specific table. You should see output like below:

```
booktown=# \d books
       Table "public.books"
   Column   |  Type   | Modifiers 
------------+---------+-----------
 id         | integer | not null
 title      | text    | not null
 author_id  | integer | 
 subject_id | integer | 
Indexes:
    "books_id_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
    "books_title_idx" btree (title)
```

###Additionally...

Your life will be made easier with a GUI PostgreSQL client. Download [PG Commander](https://eggerapps.at/pgcommander/) if you have a Mac, or [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/) if you have Linux.

1. PG Commander asks for a lot of information to begin with. The defaults are fine. Leave everything alone and just press connect.
![PG Commander new localhost connection](pg-commander-localhost-connection.png)
2. If you don't see the booktown database after connecting you may need to move up a directory. Press the "localhost" under the back and forward buttons.
3. Double click on the `booktown` database to connect.
4. See the list of tables in the database (alternate_stock, authors, book_backup...)
5. Double click a table to see it's contents
6. Double click SQL Terminal to get to a text box where you can write and execute some queries.
